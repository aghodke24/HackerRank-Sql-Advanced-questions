2. Weekend Hours Worked
The times that employees log in and out are recorded over the course of a month. For each employee, determine the number of hours worked during the weekends.
For simplicity, hours worked in a day, hours are truncated to their integer part. For example, there are 10 hours between '2000:01:01 00:45:00' and '2000:01:01 10:45:00'.
There are 9 hours between '2000:01:01 00:46:00' and '2000:01:01 10:45:00'.
Return a list of employee ids and weekend hours worked, descending by hours worked.


WITH hours_worked as (
  
SELECT
      emp_id,
  	   CASE 
       WHEN datepart(minute,TIMESTAMP) >= datepart(minute,lag(TIMESTAMP) OVER(PARTITION BY CAST(TIMESTAMP AS date),emp_id ORDER BY TIMESTAMP)) then datepart(hour,timestamp) - datepart(hour,lag(TIMESTAMP) OVER(PARTITION BY CAST(TIMESTAMP AS date),emp_id ORDER BY TIMESTAMP)) 
  	   ELSE datepart(hour,timestamp) - datepart(hour,lag(TIMESTAMP) OVER(PARTITION BY CAST(TIMESTAMP AS date),emp_id ORDER BY TIMESTAMP)) - 1
       END AS hours_worked
FROM   attendance

)
SELECT
   emp_id,
      SUM(hours_worked) as hours_worked
FROM  hours_worked
GROUP BY emp_id
ORDER BY hours_worked desc
